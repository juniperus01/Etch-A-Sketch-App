# Etch-A-Sketch-App
Elementary Python Project using Turtle Graphics 

This game works exactly same as one of the favorite childhood toys, Etch-a-Sketch. It allows us to scribble on our turtle screen using the up and down arrows to move our turtle forward and back, turn our turtle clockwise and anticlockwise to continue drawing. So we can use this to create lines, circles and various shape. And we can basically create drawings using this turtle program.
In addition to Turtle module, this project also involves knowledge in OOPs and implementation of concepts like at event listeners, higher order functions, state, and multiple instances of an object.
